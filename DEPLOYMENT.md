# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

The pkgdown website will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever you push to the main branch, thanks to the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml`).

### To enable automatic deployment:

1. **Push your changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add pkgdown website configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Divendra2006/polarisR
   - Click on "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - The workflow will automatically trigger and deploy your site

3. **Your website will be available at:**
   https://divendra2006.github.io/polarisR/

## Manual Deployment

If you prefer to build and deploy manually:

```bash
# Build the site locally
R -e "pkgdown::build_site()"

# The built site will be in the docs/ folder
# You can then push it to the gh-pages branch or use GitHub Pages source
```

## Features of Your pkgdown Website
