\title{Load Built-in Datasets for NLDR Visualization}
\usage{
load_custom_datasets()
}
\value{
A named list containing the successfully loaded datasets. Each element
is a data.frame with the following structure:
\itemize{
\item \code{$four_clusters}: data.frame with cluster analysis data
\item \code{$pdfsense}: data.frame with high-dimensional physics data
}

If any dataset fails to load, a warning is issued but the function continues,
returning only the successfully loaded datasets. An empty list is returned
if no datasets can be loaded.
}
\description{
Loads and returns a named list of built-in example datasets that are included
with the polarisR package. These datasets are specifically chosen to demonstrate
different characteristics and challenges in non-linear dimensionality reduction
analysis and visualization.
}
\note{
The function uses \code{\link[utils]{data}} to load datasets from the package
namespace. If the polarisR package is not properly installed or the data files
are missing, warnings will be generated for the affected datasets.
}
\section{Error Handling}{

The function includes robust error handling:
\itemize{
\item Each dataset is loaded in a separate \code{tryCatch} block
\item Loading failures generate warnings rather than stopping execution
\item Existence checks ensure datasets are properly loaded before inclusion
\item Environment management prevents namespace pollution
}
}

\section{Usage in Application}{

This function is typically called during application initialization to populate
the example dataset dropdown in the UI. The returned list is stored in a reactive
value and can be dynamically extended with user-uploaded datasets.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load all available datasets
datasets <- load_custom_datasets()
names(datasets)  # Shows available dataset names

# Check what was successfully loaded
if ("four_clusters" \%in\% names(datasets)) {
  dim(datasets$four_clusters)
  head(datasets$four_clusters)
}

# Use in Shiny application initialization
custom_datasets <- shiny::reactiveVal(load_custom_datasets())
available_datasets <- shiny::reactiveVal(
  c("None", names(load_custom_datasets()))
)
}
