\title{Load Built-in Datasets for NLDR Visualization}
\usage{
load_custom_datasets()
}
\value{
A named list containing the successfully loaded datasets. Each element
is a data.frame with the following structure:
\itemize{
\item \code{$four_clusters}: data.frame with cluster analysis data
\item \code{$pdfsense}: data.frame with high-dimensional physics data
\item \code{$trees}: data.frame with tree-structured synthetic data
}

If any dataset fails to load, a warning is issued but the function continues,
returning only the successfully loaded datasets. An empty list is returned
if no datasets can be loaded.
}
\description{
Loads and returns a named list of built-in example datasets that are included
with the polarisR package. These datasets are specifically chosen to demonstrate
different characteristics and challenges in non-linear dimensionality reduction
analysis and visualization.
}
\details{
This function attempts to load three key datasets from the package:

\strong{four_clusters Dataset:}
\itemize{
\item A synthetic dataset with four distinct clusters
\item 2000 observations across 4 numerical dimensions plus cluster labels
\item Generated with different shapes (gaussian, pyrrect, crescent, quadratic)
\item Ideal for testing clustering algorithms and visualization techniques
\item Useful for demonstrating clear separation in reduced dimensions
}

\strong{pdfsense Dataset:}
\itemize{
\item High-dimensional physics dataset from parton distribution function analysis
\item Contains 56 primary features (X1-X56) representing parameter variations
\item Additional metadata columns: InFit, Type, ID, pt, x, mu
\item Represents sensitivity analysis in high-energy physics
\item Excellent for testing NLDR methods on real scientific data
}

\strong{fake_trees Dataset (loaded as "trees"):}
\itemize{
\item Synthetic tree-like structure with branching patterns
\item 3000 observations with 100 dimensions (dim1-dim100) plus branch factor
\item Generated using diffusion limited aggregation simulation
\item Contains 10 distinct branching points creating tree topology
\item Perfect for testing NLDR preservation of topological structure
}
}
\note{
The function uses \code{\link[utils]{data}} to load datasets from the package
namespace. If the polarisR package is not properly installed or the data files
are missing, warnings will be generated for the affected datasets.
}
\section{Error Handling}{

The function includes robust error handling:
\itemize{
\item Each dataset is loaded in a separate \code{tryCatch} block
\item Loading failures generate warnings rather than stopping execution
\item Existence checks ensure datasets are properly loaded before inclusion
\item Environment management prevents namespace pollution
}
}

\section{Usage in Application}{

This function is typically called during application initialization to populate
the example dataset dropdown in the UI. The returned list is stored in a reactive
value and can be dynamically extended with user-uploaded datasets.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load all available datasets
datasets <- load_custom_datasets()
names(datasets)  # Shows available dataset names

# Check what was successfully loaded
if ("four_clusters" \%in\% names(datasets)) {
  dim(datasets$four_clusters)
  head(datasets$four_clusters)
}

# Use in Shiny application initialization
custom_datasets <- shiny::reactiveVal(load_custom_datasets())
available_datasets <- shiny::reactiveVal(
  c("None", names(load_custom_datasets()))
)
}
